# TMDB_ETL

### A variant of the usual data collection, usually my works involve uploading data from local CSV files via SSMS or preset datasets from existing library packages (*MNIST Data*)
### This time, I tried exploring a popular example of an ETL Pipeline demo, using the TMDB API to fetch movie data. Keep in mind, this is purely a draft to confirm connectivity above all else
### Another note is that a TMDB account is required to request an API Key, which is specific to each user dependent on the request permissions. For that reason, the config.py file will have to hide the api-key, but can be subsitituted by whichever api key is fetched from the site
